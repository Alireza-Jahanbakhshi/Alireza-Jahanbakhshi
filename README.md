### Hi there üëã
üå∫ Welcome to my GitHub.

<p align="justify">
üòè I‚Äôm Alireza. I'm an Electrical Management, Firmware/Software Engineer, and Hardware Designer at PIT. I'm also a freelancer who develops embedded software and hardware.
</p>

### About Me
<p align="justify"> 
I was born in Shiraz and raised in C&B, Iran, in 1994. I have been interested in programming and electronics since the early years. After graduating and getting a BSc from the University of Shahrekord, I tried to start my own company in the field of electronics together with my teammates. Finally, we did it in 2020. And now we are a knowledge base company.
</p>


### Interests
<p align="justify"> 
I'm passionate about electronics, microcontrollers, firmware development, software development, embedded systems, and PCB design. I love learning about new technologies and experimenting with them.
</p>


### Experience
<p align="justify"> 
I have gained valuable experience in RFID technology, specializing in designing high-performance antennas and optimizing RFID systems. This expertise has equipped me with the necessary skills and knowledge to tackle complex challenges in the field.

During my time at PIT Company, I had the opportunity to work on cutting-edge projects, such as developing a smart home automation system utilizing microcontrollers and wireless communication protocols. This experience allowed me to refine my skills in embedded systems design, firmware development, and IoT integration.

I have developed firmware for microcontrollers such as STM32 (ARM Cortex-M), STM8, Holtek, PIC, AVR, and more, using C/C++ for over 10 years. I have 8+ years of official working experience as a firmware engineer, including research, design, hardware and firmware development, prototyping, testing, and improvement. I use Altium Designer for schematic capture and PCB design. I also develop Windows software using Python for hardware tests, calibration, and configuration processes. Since 2018, as a freelancer, I have been involved in multiple projects, such as developing GUI-embedded software for medical devices using Qt, Emwin, TouchGFX, and Windows software using Python.
</p>


### Hobbies
<p align="justify"> 
I spend my leisure time exercising to keep myself healthy and fit. I also love learning English to improve my communication skills. In addition, I keep myself up-to-date with new technologies in the field of electronics by reading blogs and attending conferences. Finally, I enjoy teaching online to share my knowledge with others.
</p>


### Current Employment
I am currently employed at PIT Company, where I am involved in developing various devices. In parallel, I am also teaching microprocessor courses at SKU university.
