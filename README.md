### Hi there üëã
üå∫ Welcome to my GitHub.

<p align="justify">
üòè I‚Äôm Alireza. I'm an Electrical Management, Firmware/Software Engineer, and Hardware Designer at PIT. I'm also a freelancer who develops embedded software and hardware.
</p>

### About Me
<p align="justify"> 
I was born in Shiraz and raised in C&B, Iran, in 1994. I have been interested in programming and electronics since the early years. After graduating and getting a BSc from the University of Shahrekord, I tried to start my own company in the field of electronics together with my teammates. Finally, we did it in 2020. And now we are a knowledge base company.
</p>


### Interests
<p align="justify"> 
I'm passionate about electronics, microcontrollers, firmware development, software development, embedded systems, and PCB design. I love learning about new technologies and experimenting with them.
</p>


### Experience
<p align="justify"> 
I have developed firmware for microcontrollers such as STM32 (ARM Cortex-M), STM8, Holtek, PIC, AVR, and so on, using C/C++ for 10+ years. I have 8+ years of official working experience as a firmware engineer developing microcontroller-based products, including research, design, hardware and firmware development, prototype, test, and improvement. I use Altium Designer for schematic capture and PCB design. I develop Windows software using Python and various software to automate hardware tests, calibration, and configuration processes. Since 2018 as a freelancer, I have been involved in multiple projects such as Medical Devices GUI-embedded software using Qt, Emwin, TouchGFX, and Windows software using Python.
</p>


### Hobbies
<p align="justify"> 
I spend my leisure time exercising to keep myself healthy and fit. I also love learning English to improve my communication skills. In addition to that, I keep myself up-to-date with new technologies in the field of electronics by reading blogs and attending conferences. Finally, I enjoy teaching online to share my knowledge with others.
